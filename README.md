# GraphS-system
This repository contains a our work about the "Real-time Constrained Cycle Detection in Large Dynamic Graphs" paper, which present a GraphS system to efficiently detect constrained cycles in a dynamic graph, which is changing constantly, and return the satisfying cycles in real-time.
